# Predicting Solar Spectra
CSE 583 Class Project

## Project Description
This project is an analysis project that aims to study if it is possible to accurately predict the solar spectra given atmospheric parameters. 

## Data
The training data comes from [NREL Solar Radiation Research Laboratory](https://midcdmz.nrel.gov/apps/sitehome.pl?site=BMS) where numerous atmospheric data is being measured. **Training data** is divided into two parts **(1) Atmospheric weather data (2) Continuous Solar spectra data**.

### Atmospheric Parameters
These are data that is measured
